# Constraint-Satisfaction-In-POS-Tagging
This project implements a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)–based framework for Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging. Instead of relying on probabilistic NLP systems (HMMs, CRFs) or neural sequence models (Transformers, LLMs), this implementation applies deterministic rule-based reasoning through explicit syntactic constraints.
